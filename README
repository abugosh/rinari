Emacs support for using the Sinatra web development DSL

This includes...
- a major mode combining ruby-mode and haml-mode for you main sinatra
  file
- a command `sinatra-console' for quickly running irb in your sinatra
  environment
- a command `sinatra-web-server' for quickly running your sinatra
  web-server allowing jumping from errors to source
- bundled with some basic ruby modes

To use Sinatra-Modes...
1) add this directory to your load path
2) add this to your .emacs init file (require 'sinatra)
3) open your sinatra application file, and run M-x sinatra-mode

Note:
due to limitation of MuMaMo-mode (or my understanding thereof) you
must add the following haml comment line to the bottom of your file
for haml mode to turn on following the __END__ marker.

-#end-of-file
