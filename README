This includes...
- a major mode combining ruby-mode and haml-mode for you main sinatra file
- a command for quickly running irb in your sinatra environment

- bundled with some basic ruby modes

To use these Sinatra modes...

2) add this to your .emacs init file
    (require 'sinatra)
3) open your sinatra application file, and run M-x sinatra-launch
